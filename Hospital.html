<h1>ORGAN DONATION</h1>
<h2>HOSPITALS </h2><br>
      <p>One organ donor can save up to eight lives. The same donor can also save or improve the lives of up to 50 people by donating tissues and eyes. More than 120,000 people are waiting for organ transplants.
	  <br>
	  1 organ donor can save 8 lives and change the lives of more than 50 people.
Almost anyone can be an organ donor, regardless of age or medical history.
All major religions in the U.S. support organ donation.
Donors can still have open casket funerals, and organ donation doesn't cost the donor's family any money.
If a person is hospitalized, the medical staff provides the best possible care, regardless of organ donor status. Donation is only considered after a patient has died.
Donors are needed for all races and ethnic groups. Transplant success rates increase when organs are matched between members of the same ethnic background.</p><br>
